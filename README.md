## My Team

Content creators: PU Xiao, Zhanmo Ni, Zhening Zhang

Website designer: Feifei Sun

All three content creators participated in brainstorming, project designing, coding, and writing. The main responsibilities of each person are written below: Zhening proposed the idea, organized the meeting, and wrote R codes for interactive plots in Introduction and Step 2. Pu carried out the best subset regression in Step 1, designed some interactive plots in Step 3, and wrote the Discussion and Conclusion. Zhanmo constructed our dataset by filtering the FIFA dataset, studied pace vs npxG_diff in Step 3, and contributed all the writing parts of this report. Feifei designed and built the website.
